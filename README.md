This is my first Applied Machine Learning ModelðŸ˜¸
The goal was to train a percepton (Single layer of a Neural Network)
This model is a clasiffier Model with Scikit Learn which I am still new on
The model managed to get an accuracy score of 1.0 
I am yet to enhance my skills in the Data Cleaning as I had few challenges with importing my Csv file
